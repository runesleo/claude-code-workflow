# General workflow

Generated target: `opencode`
Generated profile: `opencode-default`
Applied overlay: `none`

## Working rules

- `ssot-first` (`mandatory`) — Keep repository files as the single source of truth; tool-managed memory is cache.
- `verify-before-claim` (`mandatory`) — Never claim completion without fresh verification evidence.
- `capability-tier-routing` (`mandatory`) — Route by capability tier first, then resolve through the active provider profile.
- `reversible-small-batches` (`recommended`) — Prefer small, reversible, single-purpose changes over large mixed batches.
- `root-cause-debugging` (`mandatory`) — Investigate root cause before attempting fixes and reassess after repeated failures.
- `security-escalation` (`mandatory`) — Treat destructive commands, network egress, secret access, and obfuscation as security-sensitive actions.
- `record-reusable-learning` (`recommended`) — Record user corrections, repeated failures, and counter-intuitive discoveries for reuse.
